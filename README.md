## Commands

### Export available databases

`bin/typo3cms ddev:exportdb` exports all configured databases.

The export is rather clever and exports the structure of all tables (so
`ddev importdb` works) but leaves out all unnecessary data like caching tables,
session tables etc.

Optional arguments:
`snapshot` stores a **copy** of the exported data into a timestamped folder

Usage:
`bin/typo3cms ddev:exportdb snapshot`

Note:
This command currently relies on mysqldump, so results may vary (in the sense
that I doubt it'll do **anything** on MSSQL :)
